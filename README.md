# Dynamics Toolkit
**Engineering Tools for Structural Dynamics**

Built by **SideQuestForge**, the engineering lab of a Structural Dynamics Engineer at NASA. These tools are designed to solve the real-world problems faced by dynamicists daily—without the bloat, licensing fees, or installation headaches of traditional software.

## The Tools

### [Shock Response Spectrum (SRS) Calculator](https://sidequestforge.github.io/dynamics-toolkit/srs-calculator/)
A stateless, browser-based SRS calculator using SDOF time-domain integration.
- **Inputs**: Half-Sine, Sawtooth pulses.
- **Outputs**: Interactive Maximax Absolute Acceleration Spectrum.
- **Features**: Instant client-side calculation, interactive plots, no login required.

## About SideQuestForge
SideQuestForge is dedicated to building high-quality, "stateless" engineering tools. We believe that critical analysis tools should be accessible, reliable, and fast.
